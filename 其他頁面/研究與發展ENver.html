    <h2>Research Significance</h2>
    <article>
        <p>
            <h3>&sectComputer Engineering</h3>
            emphasizing Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence and Real-Time Computing System, especially the application of computer science in the other fields of engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>&sectControl Engineering</h3>
            emphasizing Analysis & Design of Control System and Automation, including Control System Theory Analysis and Design of Electronics Circuits, in order to combine with the principles of Applied Mechanics for Structure Design and to integrate with Computing Techniques for System Automation.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>&sectApplied Mechanics</h3>
            Applied Mechanics is the principal engineering for Analysis and Design of Structures. In Applied Mechanics, we emphasize the basic training in Solid Mechanics and Thermo-Fluid Mechanics. Simulation, computation and automation of structural systems can then be accomplished by integrating with Computer and Control Engineering.

        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>&sectSystem Engineering</h3>
            emphasizing the manufacture, research and application of MEMS
        </p>
        
        <h2>Future Development</h2>
        <p>
            The main goal of our future development is to educate our students to become engineers with system engineering technology, system analysis techniques and creative minds to meet the nation's progressive demands of modern engineering. To achieve this goal, the Department has cooperated with other departments in the College of Engineering. Several research groups, e.g., the Distributed Computing Research Group, the Electronic Packaging Research Group, the Automation Research Group, the Micro system Group, and the I.C. Card Research Group have been established.
