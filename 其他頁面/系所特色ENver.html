    <h1>Specialty</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        As compared with the departments having a specialized program for electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and computer science, the Department of Engineering Science offers the discipline underpinning all modern engineering practice. Students of our department develop a broad view of the subject to accomplish system integration, but can also choose from a very wide range of specialist options including <em>computer engineering, control engineering, applied mechanics and so on</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our department comprises of five research groups (and their research fields as listed below) that are responsible for undergraduate teaching, graduate student affairs, and research.
        <br>A.Electrical Control and Communication: electronic design automation, automatic control, and communication and signal processing.
        <br>B.Computer Science and Its Applications: software engineering, artificial intelligence, real-time computing, computer networking, and multimedia applications.
        <br>C.Quantum Computing: quantum technology, quantum informatics, quantum control, and quantum biology.
        <br>D.Applied Mechanics: system in package (SiP), thermo-fluid sciences, solid mechanics, and system simulation.
        <br>E.System Integration, Nano and Bio Technology: micro/nano-technology, semiconductor manufacturing, electronic packaging, microfluidics, nano-mot-motor (NMM), microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), biochip, and optoelctronics.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every year our department produces around 70 new engineering graduates. They go off to a huge variety of occupations. Specifically, the curriculum developed by the five research groups is to prepare our graduates with the ability to solve real world engineering, business and industrial problems, including but not limited to the following topics.
        <br>1.Real-time computing systems: to utilize learned knowledge from courses of computer organization, real-time operating systems, fault tolerance, and design patterns. Practical applications include in-vehicle navigation, monitoring of nuclear plants, unmanned factory, and robot control.
        <br>2.Artificial intelligence and software engineering: to develop the human-like intelligence exhibited by machines or software. The core problems include natural language processing, expert systems, reasoning, and computer vision.
        <br>3.Computation and simulation: to optimize the performance of an engineering system by carefully and precisely adjusting various parameter settings. Consequently, computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided engineering (CAE) become increasingly crucial for system analysis, simulation, and manufacturing.
        <br>4.Thermo-fluid sciences and solid mechanics: to exploit learned knowledge from courses of thermo-fluid system analysis and design, solidification theory, convective heat transfer, viscous flow, elasticity, plasticity, viscoelasticity, and fracture mechanics.
        <br>5.Control systems: to design appropriate input signals and corresponding controllers to control a system. There are various applications (e.g., robot control, flight control, and automation systems), and extensive research issues (e.g., adaptive control, fuzzy control, and intelligent control.)
        <br>6.System automation: to integrate technologies of optoelectronics, mechanics, control, and information. An inter-discipline is thus formed to make a system smartly sense, aware, and interact with its users.
        <br>7.System engineering: to conduct system identification, simulation, and technology fusion. Focused issues are mechatronics, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), biochip design, and IC packaging.
    </p>
    <p>
        Visions of our department are to gradually diverting the direction to a state-of-the-art research oriented towards world-wide trends and local needs. The key feature of engineering science is the use of advanced mathematics and technology to solve real world engineering, business and industrial problems in different fields, e.g., IC manufacturing, information technologies, and biotechnologies. We have a substantial research portfolio, including a great deal of multi-disciplinary research collaborating with groups in other departments, such as the Center for Micro/Nano Science and Technology, and the University Center for Bioscience and Biotechnology. This broad view of engineering, based on a scientific approach to the fundamentals, is started with our foundation in 1965 - fifty years of educating great engineers, and researching at the cutting edge!
